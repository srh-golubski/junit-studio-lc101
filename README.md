Write unit tests to find the errors in BalancedBrackets.

The tests you write should guide how you revise the sourcecode. Use TDD to first write tests that will work for the desired behavior of BalancedBrackets. When your tests fail, correct the class to pass your tests.

The content of your tests is up to you, but you should write at least 12 tests.
